Work left:

0) Create PDF document containing schema diagram (you can create a screenshot of our tables for this).

1) Sample Data - Add couple more Devices and Employees, create several (5-6) DeviceRecords with different check out and return times. You can delete the current device records from the sample data.

2) SQL Query 1: Computes a join of at least three tables
3) SQL Query 2: Uses nested queries with the ANY or ALL operator and uses a GROUP BY clause
4) SQL Query 2: A correlated nested query
5) SQL Query 4: Uses a FULL JOIN
6) SQL Query 5: Uses nested queries with any of the set operations UNION, EXCEPT, or INTERSECT
7) SQL Query 6: Create your  own non-trivial SQL query
8) SQL Query 7: Create your  own non-trivial SQL query
9) SQL Query 8: Create your  own non-trivial SQL query
10) SQL Query 9: Create your  own non-trivial SQL query
11) SQL Query 10: Create your  own non-trivial SQL query

12) Document Create table commands
13) Document sample data commands
14) Document SQL Queries (Ensure that proper documentation is provided for each query including a query (a) number, (b) purpose and (c) summary of the expected result.)
